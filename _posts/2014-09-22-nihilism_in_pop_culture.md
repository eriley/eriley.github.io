#Nihilism in Pop Culture


Over the course of the summer I started listening to podcast more, I've learned so much about [Space](http://www.startalkradio.net/), [Web Development](http://shoptalkshow.com), [History](http://www.missedinhistory.com/), and so much more. Along with that, I've learned more about myself.

One of the podcast that I can't recommend enough is [RadioLab](http://www.radiolab.org/). But one of their latest podcast, [In The Dust Of This Planet](http://www.radiolab.org/story/dust-planet/) was insanely interesting to me. Without transcribing the podcast here, and not allowing you the joy of listening to it, the episode is about the recurring sense of nihilism in Pop Culture, or more importantly everyday life. 

Multiple exeprts go into detail of why people are nihilistic, or pessimistic. Why nihilism seems "cool", or and todays generation of young adults and teens seem so pessimistic, and why our general view of the future is overwhemingly negative. I HIGHLY recommend as many people listen to this episode. 

Again, you can listen here: [In The Dust Of This Planet](http://www.radiolab.org/story/dust-planet/)
